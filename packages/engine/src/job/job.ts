/**
 * Abstract base class for Sidequest jobs.
 * Concrete job classes should extend this class and implement the `run` method.
 *
 * There are a few convenience methods that can be used to return early and trigger a transition:
 * - `snooze(delay: number)`: Returns a SnoozeResult to delay the job execution for a specified time.
 * - `retry(reason: string | Error, delay?: number)`: Returns a RetryResult to retry the job with an optional delay.
 * - `fail(reason: string | Error)`: Returns a FailedResult to mark the job as failed with a reason.
 * - `complete(result: unknown)`: Returns a CompletedResult to mark the job as completed with a result.
 *
 * Calling any of these methods without returning its result will do absolutely nothing. Thus, you need to return
 * the result of any of these methods to trigger the job transition.
 *
 * If there is an uncaught error in the `run` method, it will automatically return a RetryResult with the error data.
 *
 *  @example
 * ```typescript
 * class MyJob extends Job {
 *   async run(arg1: string, arg2: number): Promise<string> {
 *     // Your job logic here
 *    if (someCondition) {
 *      return this.snooze(1000); // Delay the job for 1 second
 *    }
 *    if (anotherCondition) {
 *      return this.retry(new Error("Retrying due to some condition"), 500); // Retry after 500ms
 *    }
 *    if (yetAnotherCondition) {
 *     return this.fail("Failed due to some reason"); // Mark the job as failed
 *    }
 *    // If everything is fine, return the result
 *    return this.complete("Job completed successfully"); // Mark the job as completed
 *    // Alternatively, you can just return a value, which will be treated as the job result:
 *    return "Job completed successfully";
